## Initial T-tests
A T-test was done for each VD3 and Wild Type at each level provided for both Triclopyr and Glyphosate plants.   

Null hypothesis: No difference between VD3 and Wild Type necrotic level
Alternative hypothesis: Difference between VD3 and Wild Type necrotic level

## Triclopyr results
**Water**   
P-value: -3.182446  3.182446    
 "Fail to reject null hypothesis"   

**33% Diluted Herbicide**   
P-values -3.038819  3.038819    
 "Reject null hypothesis"

**43% Diluted Herbicide**   
P-value: -2.449178  2.449178    
 "Reject null hypothesis"

**Undiluted (100%) Herbicide**   
P-value: -2.812738  2.812738    
 "Reject null hypothesis"   


 ## Glyphosate results

**1% Diluted Herbicide**    
P-Values -3.182443  3.182443    
"Reject null hypothesis"        

**33% Diluted Herbicide**   
P-value: -4.302537  4.302537    
 "Reject null hypothesis"   

**Undiluted (100%) Herbicide**   
P-value: -3.177676  3.177676    
 "Reject null hypothesis"

## Tukey Test for Tricoplyr:
A Tukey test shows which specific groupsâ€™ means (compared with each other) are different or significant. This is done because an ANOVA test alone is limited in providing detailed insights between different treatments/groups. R has a built in Tukey function called `TukeyHSD`. The `TukeyHSD` function in R returns the p-values for each level of mean comparison. Here is the table that is returned using that function.

## Equivalence Testing for Glyphosate

Since the resulting ANOVA table for Glyphosates gave results with p-values way above .05, a separate Equivalence test was done on the Glyphosate data. The TOST ``"TOSTER"`` package, and it's function: `TOSTtwo.raw()`, was used to calculate whether or not there was equivalence

**Equivalence Results:**    
The **null hypothesis being if the two plants (VD3 AND Wild Type) are different and the alternate being that they are equivalent** within an acceptable preset limit theta (or bounds) (0% was omitted to due lack of enough values)

**Theta bound:** ln(1.25)


**1% Diluted Herbicide**    
p-value lower bound: 0.230    
p-value upper bound: 0.765    
The equivalence test was *non-significant*, t(6) = 0.770, p = 0.765, given equivalence bounds of -0.223 and 0.223 (on a raw scale) and an alpha of 0.05

**33% Diluted Herbicide**     
p-value lower bound: 0.967    
p-value upper bound: 0.030    
The equivalence test was *non-significant*, t(5) = -2.345, p = 0.967, given equivalence bounds of -0.223 and 0.223 (on a raw scale) and an alpha of 0.05

**Undiluted (100%) Herbicide**    
p-value lower bound: 0.948    
p-value upper bound: 0.048    
The equivalence test was *non-significant*, t(6) = -1.912, p = 0.948, given equivalence bounds of -0.223 and 0.223 (on a raw scale) and an alpha of 0.05
