# Strand-Herbicide-Analysis
Done for Professor Stuart Strand

A T-test was done for each VD3 and Wild Type at each level provided for both Triclopyr and Glyphosate plants.   

Null hypothesis: No difference between VD3 and Wild Type necrotic level
Alternative hypothesis: Difference between VD3 and Wild Type necrotic level
